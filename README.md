# gmg - a GroupMe Client

This project is a fully-featured Electron and Angular 4 GroupMe client for the desktop.

It makes use of GroupMe's extensive public-facing API and push messaging system to function.

## Features

Currently the client is a WIP. Features that have yet to be implemented can be found with the "feature" and "v1" tags under Issues.


## Installation and Usage 

An installation and usage section is forthcoming- the app isn't done yet!

## Credits

Most of the setup code for this project came from Maxime Gris' ["Angular Electron" repo](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron). Thanks for doing the setup for me!
